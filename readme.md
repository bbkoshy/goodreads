#**goodreads bookshelf**

##**Creative Brief:**

###**Objectives:** The goal of this project is to create a  better user experience for the book lovers that subscribe to good reads. Good reads is a site that houses readers and their recommendations. It is a marriage of social media and e commerce for book lovers. You can find out which books your followers are reading and you can track your own books and recommend books to others as well. With a mission like that, we want to make sure that we incorporate all of these existing aspects to our redesign of the checkout/bookshelf process.

###**Purpose:** To give book lovers a space that is their own. The bookshelf should evoke the same feelings a physical book shelf would. The process of checking out books should be clean and simple. The only part of this where the users have to think should be regarding what types of books are on their shelves. We want to be able to give book lovers a way to organize the books that they are reading as well.

###**Target Audience:** The target audience will be the current customers of good reads. We will also be targeting other book lovers from our competitors such as barnes and noble and half priced books. 

### **End Result:** In the end, we want a polished product in which people can have hundreds of bookshelves specific to their tastes and desired categories but are able to navigate through them and other books easily. We want a clean end user experience for these booklovers.
